# +, -, *, /, **, // , %

# a = 5
# b = 10

# print(a + b)
# print(a - b)
# print(a * b)
# print(a / b)
# print(a // b)

# print(a ** b)
# print(a % b)






# Assignment Operators
#  =, +=, -=, *=, /=

# a = 5
# b = 10

# a += b  # a = a+b
# print(a)






# Comparison Operators
# 1. Equal( == )
# 2. Not Equal( != )
# 3. Greater than( > )
# 4. Less than ( < )
# 5. Greater than equal to ( >= )
# 6. Less than equal to( <= )


# a = 5
# b = 10

# print(a >= b)










# Logical Operators
# and, or, not

# a = True
# b = False
# c = True


# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(not a)






# Identity Operators
# is, is not


# a = 5
# b = 5

# print(a is b)

# Membership Operators
# in, not in

li= [1,2,3,4]
